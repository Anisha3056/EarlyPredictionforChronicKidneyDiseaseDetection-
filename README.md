# Early Prediction for Chronic Kidney Disease Detection-
End-to-end analysis and prediction of Chronic Kidney Disease using Python (EDA, ML models, documentation).


## Project Overview
Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a major health concern that requires early diagnosis to prevent severe outcomes.  
This project focuses on analyzing patient data, exploring clinical features, and building predictive models for early CKD detection.  

This project was completed as part of an **internship**, in collaboration with a team.  
**My contribution:** Data cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), visualization, and complete project documentation.

##  Dataset
- Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mansoordaku/ckdisease
- Size: 400 patient records  
- Features: Clinical measurements, demographic details, lab test results  

---

##  Tools & Technologies
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)  
- **Jupyter Notebook**  
- **EDA & Visualization**  
- **Documentation**  

---

##  Steps & Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handled missing values & duplicates  
   - Converted categorical values into numerical form  
   - Treated outliers for specific lab results  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Distribution analysis of lab parameters  
   - Correlation heatmaps for feature relationships  
   - Visualization of CKD vs non-CKD patterns  

3. **Model Building (Team Contribution)**
   - Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, 10+ Algorithms tested and evaluated
   - Performance evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score  

4. **Documentation**
   - Wrote detailed project methodology, observations, and conclusions  

---

##  Key Insights
- Features like **serum creatinine, albumin, hemoglobin, and blood pressure** had strong impact on CKD prediction.  
- Data imbalance was handled with resampling techniques.  
- Best performing model achieved **98.75% accuracy**   

---

##  Results
- Early prediction of CKD with high accuracy  
- Insights into which medical features are most critical for diagnosis  
- Visualizations showing patient trends and risk factors
